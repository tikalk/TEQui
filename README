I have used yo to create angular project

assuming you have yo + bower on your computer.
run the following :

1.npm install -g generator-angular
2.yo angular
3.checkout TEQui from git and replace app directory with the one in git

run command:
grunt server


once the server run you need, and you can see HTML pagr on your browser, click on "teq builder" tab and click Build button, this will create on your browser teqs samples.
to chnage the teqs and update app.js see "init" function in "repositoryService".

Note: this is only initilal step for moving repository to server, the current state save the TEQs on localstorage.
